# SentinelMobs
Config files for mythical mobs, these are mobs used in the SentinelCraft mob arena

MobArenaMobs.yml is the file to create new mobs within, this allows you to refer to items from MobArenaItems.yml and specific skills from MobArenaSkills.yml

Ensure everything is named correctly and easier to reference what it would be.
