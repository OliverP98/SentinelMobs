# SentinelMobs
Config files for mythical mobs, these are mobs used in the SentinelCraft mob arena

This is still a work in progress and there is much to do and a lot which needs refining to a polished state. The order of importance for the development of new custom mobs:

1. Basic idea of a mob which would go into the MobArenaMobs.yml
2. Once basic idea of mob is produced, look at developing the skills/abilities the custom mob would have. All these skills are outlined in MobArenaSkills.yml and referenced in MobArenaMobs.yml. One skill could be referenced by more than one mob, but ensure each skill per mob is unique as it allows more controls when editing and balancing individual mobs.
3. Each mob could have custom items which give them special abilities and this is all outlined in MobArenaItems.yml. This is mostly to give weapons or Armour.
4. MobArenaDropsTables.yml should be left till near the end of the development of the custom mobs, this allows for custom items to be dropped within the mob area to a player from a specific loot table to make each playthrough unique and helps increase playablity. As for these items, I would perfer them to be consuables such as food or potions, or skill effects than just base armour or weapons.


When editing make sure everything is named correctly and from now do start adding comments to everything with thinking as this will help with working together and editing it to something that is workable. Also make sure everything has sensible names which are unique enough, short names could confuse things.
